I originally started this project thinking that this activity would be quite easy, however, that was the wrong mindset for me. I found that I couldn't reliably remember the exact notation I needed to get the results I needed. As such, I felt that I needed to search a lot more than I needed. 

There are some issues I couldn't fix (at least at the time of writing)
These include:
    1. Properly changing the overlay color over the NFT image when hovering.
    2. General spacing of the card and background.
    3. Confirming mobile and desktop sites are consistent.

Those being said, it was a fun challenge that I obviously need to work on in the future.
